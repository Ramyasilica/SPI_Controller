# SPI_Controller

🌍 Welcome World!

Welcome to my **third GitHub repository** 🎉
This project is a **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Controller RTL design** implemented using **Verilog HDL** and verified through **behavioral simulation**.

This repository is created to learn, implement, and understand **SPI protocol communication** at the RTL level, including **master–slave interaction and full-duplex data transfer**.

📌 What is SPI?

SPI (**Serial Peripheral Interface**) is a **synchronous serial communication protocol** used for high-speed data transfer between a **master** and one or more **slaves**.

SPI communication uses:
* A dedicated **clock signal**
* Separate lines for **data transmission and reception**
* A **chip select** signal to choose the active slave

SPI is commonly used in:
* Embedded systems
* Sensors and ADCs/DACs
* Memory devices
* FPGA-based communication designs

## Project Overview

This repository presents a **SPI Controller RTL implementation** consisting of **one SPI Master and one SPI Slave**.

The design intentionally considers **a single-master, single-slave configuration** to keep the SPI communication clear, simple, and easy to understand at the RTL level. This setup closely reflects many real-world embedded systems where a processor communicates with only one peripheral device.

The SPI master is responsible for:
* Generating the SPI clock (`sclk`)
* Controlling the chip select (`cs`)
* Initiating and managing data transfer

The SPI slave responds to the master by:
* Receiving data from `mosi`
* Transmitting data on `miso`

This project demonstrates **full-duplex data transfer**, where both master and slave send and receive data simultaneously during a single SPI transaction. The functionality is verified through simulation, confirming correct control signaling, clock synchronization, and data integrity between the master and the slave.


## Master Signals
* `sclk` – SPI clock generated by master
* `mosi` – Master Out Slave In
* `miso` – Master In Slave Out
* `cs` – Chip Select (active low)
* `start` – Initiates SPI transaction
* `done` – Indicates transaction completion
* `m_tx_data[7:0]` – Data transmitted by master
* `m_rx_data[7:0]` – Data received by master
* `clk` – System clock
* `reset` – Reset

## Master Working
1. On `start`, master asserts `cs` low
2. SPI clock (`sclk`) is generated
3. Master transmits data on `mosi`
4. Master simultaneously receives data on `miso`
5. After 8 bits, `cs` is deasserted
6. `done` goes high indicating end of transfer


## SPI Slave

## Slave Signals
* `mosi` – Receives data from master
* `miso` – Sends data to master
* `cs` – Slave select
* `s_tx_data[7:0]` – Data transmitted by slave
* `s_rx_data[7:0]` – Data received by slave

## Slave Working
1. Slave becomes active when `cs` is low
2. Samples incoming data from `mosi`
3. Shifts out its own data on `miso`
4. Captures received data after full transaction


## Full-Duplex Data Transfer

SPI supports **simultaneous transmission and reception**.

From the simulation:
* Master sends: `0xA5`
* Slave sends: `0x3C`
* Master receives: `0x3C`
* Slave receives: `0xA5`

This confirms **correct full-duplex SPI communication**.


## 📊 Simulation Results

From the simulation waveform:

* `cs` is asserted low before data transfer
* `sclk` toggles only during active communication
* `mosi` and `miso` shift data synchronously with `sclk`
* Master and slave exchange data correctly
* `done` asserts after successful transfer

✅ These results confirm the **SPI controller works correctly**.


## Features

* SPI Master and Slave implemented in Verilog HDL
* Full-duplex data transfer
* Proper chip-select handling
* Clean clock-synchronized data shifting
* Verified using behavioral simulation
* Beginner-friendly RTL design
